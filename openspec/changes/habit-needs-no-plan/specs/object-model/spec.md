## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Validation

A `validate` operation SHALL check the whole workspace and report findings with severity `error`, `warning`, or `info`. Errors SHALL include: dangling references, unknown reference roles, cycles in the intention serves graph, unparseable EDTF or ISO 8601 values, unknown retirement kinds, `superseded` without `superseded_by`, duplicate active instances for one occurrence, an intention or availability with no author, `firm` on an intention whose `source` carries a harness and which has no `firmed_under`, `firmed_under` naming anything other than an active, firm policy of the intention's subject, `firmed_under` on a terminus, `auto_select` or `auto_firm` on an intention that is not a terminus, `cadence` on an object whose window has no calendar anchor, `habit` on an intention without `cadence`, a sub-day RRULE part in `cadence`, a fractional duration on an all-day placement, a DESIRE carrying any field of an intention's temporal or deontic kind (`duration`, `window`, `stability`, `parties`, `cadence`, `auto_select`, `auto_firm`, `firmed_under`, `placement`, `acknowledgements`), a DESIRE `serves` entry with any role but `for-the-sake-of`, `adopted` without `adopted_as` or `adopted_as` naming anything but an intention, `superseded_by` on a desire naming anything but a desire, and `transparent` on a commitment born of a resolution. Under `intentions/0.2` errors SHALL also include an intention that reaches no firm terminus of its own subject, named with the fix; under `intentions/0.1` that finding is a warning. Warnings SHALL include a RESOLUTION record whose `selector` names a policy that is no longer firm or no longer active, as an act authorised when it happened under a policy since withdrawn; the placement it produced stands and is the person's to keep or re-resolve. Info SHALL include a tentative terminus, as a draft. Validation SHALL be runnable in continuous integration and SHALL exit non-zero on any error.

Where a write operation can determine that the result would fail validation with an error, it SHALL refuse the write. Where it can determine that the result would carry a warning, it SHALL accept the write and report the warning in its result. Write-time refusal is a convenience; validation is the invariant, because files may arrive by merge without passing through any write operation.

#### Scenario: Merge introduces error
- **WHEN** two branches each add one valid reference and the merged result contains a cycle
- **THEN** validation on the merged workspace reports the cycle as an error even though neither write was refused

#### Scenario: Unauthorised firming detected after the fact
- **WHEN** a merged intention carries `stability: firm`, a `source.harness`, and no `firmed_under`
- **THEN** validation reports an error naming the intention

#### Scenario: Workspace without termini under 0.1
- **WHEN** a workspace whose `format` is `intentions/0.1` holds intentions and no terminus
- **THEN** validation reports every non-terminus intention as unserved at warning level and exits zero

#### Scenario: Workspace without termini under 0.2
- **WHEN** a workspace whose `format` is `intentions/0.2` holds intentions and no terminus
- **THEN** validation reports every non-terminus intention as unserved at error level and exits non-zero

#### Scenario: Firmed under a draft
- **WHEN** an intention carries `firmed_under` naming a policy whose `stability` is `tentative`
- **THEN** validation reports an error naming the intention and the policy

#### Scenario: Selected under a policy since withdrawn
- **WHEN** a RESOLUTION record's `selector` names a policy that has since been set tentative or retired
- **THEN** validation reports a warning on the record and does not exit non-zero for it

#### Scenario: Habit on an instance
- **WHEN** a generated instance carries `habit: true`
- **THEN** validation reports an error naming the instance and the field
